== About
Lime is a high score server written for the Corona mobile device framework.

The goal of lime is to offer similar functionality to cocoslive.net, but in
a manner more tailored to lua development.

The server side portion of lime runs on google app engine, and is implemented
in clojure.

Right now we're concentrating on the client libraries for lua sdks, but in the
future there will be an objective C client as well.
